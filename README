This is gitbox extracted from git and modified to run standalone.
Gitbox is a stripped down version of busybox modified to compile under
Windows with MINGW, this version should also compile on Linux and Mac OS X.

Normally a simple 'make' is enough to build it, the command to build
it under Windows with the Cygwin compiler is in makecmd-cygwin.
