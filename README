* What is it?

This is a generic wrapper interpreter (scriptable as the POSIX shell). It is
very much based on GitBox that was extracted from git and modified to run
standalone. Gitbox is a stripped down version of BusyBox modified to compile
under Windows with MinGW. This version should also compile on Linux and
Mac OS X (and probably more but those are not tested) besides Windows.

* Building

Normally a simple 'make' is enough to build it for the same platform you are
currently running, but it can also be cross-compiled for another platform
(see below for instructions).

* Cross-compiling

For cross-compiling you should set the TARGET variable. (Additionally setting
CC, AR and STRIP or other variables may also be necessary if defaults are not
sufficient).

* Cross-compiling on Unix/Linux (also includes Mac OS X) to Windows

- To set up cross-compiling environment:
1. Get the 'Cross-Hosted MinGW Build Tool' script from the MinGW download page
   (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435)
	 Tested with x86-mingw32-build.sh-0.0-20061107-1
2. Set the package versions in x86-mingw32-build.sh.conf, tested with:
   GCC_VERSION                   3.4.5-20060117-1
   BINUTILS_VERSION              2.18.50-20080109-2
   RUNTIME_VERSION               3.14
   W32API_VERSION                3.11
3. Run the script to get and build cross-compiling environment

- To compile simply do:

make TARGET=/path/to/mingw/install/dir/bin/i386-mingw32

* Cross-compiling on Cygwin to Windows

To compile with the Cygwin compiler install the mingw versions from setup.exe
and then you can issue the following command:

make TARGET=mingw CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" AR=ar STRIP=strip
