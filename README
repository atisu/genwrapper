This is gitbox extracted from git, a stripped down version of busybox
modified to compile under Windows with MINGW.

Under Linux a simple 'make' is enough to build it, the command to build
it under Windows with the Cygwin compiler is in makecmd-cygwin, the
command for Mac OS X is in makecmd-darwin.

The executable is built as gitbox but expects to be named "box" otherwise
it only produces an Applet not found error.
