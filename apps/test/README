 1.) What is This ?

 
 A test application for the generic wrapper for BOINC.
 
 This script resolves the files "in" and "out". Reads a number (NUM) from in. For this 
 many times the script sleeps 1 second, reports the finished percentage (100 / NUM * %iter%)
 the Core Client and writes it to "out".
 
 To run it in standalon mode, copy the modified gitbox into this directory and rename it
 to box, run "doit.sh"
 
 The main script is test.sh.
 

 
 2.) Currently available BOINC functions

 
 boinc init  -  this is only for "cosmetical" reasons. In reality boinc_init() is invoked 
                when the shell executes.
		
 boinc resolve_filename %FILENAME%  - resolves the given filename and prints it to stdout.
 
 boinc fraction_done - report the fraction done (0.00 <= x <= 1.00) the Core Client.
 
 boinc fraction_done_perecent - the same, but 0 <= x <= 100
 
 boinc finish %status% - invoke boinc_finish(status)
 

 
 3.) Notes

 
 - tested only on Linux and in standalone mode...
