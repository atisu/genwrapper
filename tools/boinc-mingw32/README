 1.) Prerequisites
 
 Debian 5.0
 MinGW32 debian packages
 BOINC 6 source


 2.) How to compile

 To compile BOINC 6 with mingw32, use the following command 
 (use the location of the BOINC 6 source for BOINCDIR):
 
 $> make TARGET=i586-mingw32msvc BOINCDIR=../../../../boinc/boinc-6/
	
 This will produce a file "libboinc.a" which can be linked with
 GenWrapper, and will copy the necessary header files into a directory
 named include/ .
